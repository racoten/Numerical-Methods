function derivative = derivative_of_problem3_equation(f, Re)
    % Analytical or numerical derivative of the von Karman equation with respect to f
    % You need to derive this expression based on the original von Karman equation
    % For example (this is NOT the correct derivative, just a placeholder):
    derivative = -0.5 * f^(-1.5) - 4 * Re * 0.5 * f^(-0.5) / (log(10) * (Re * sqrt(f)));
